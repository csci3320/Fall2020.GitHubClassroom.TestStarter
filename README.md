# Fall2020.GitHubClassroom.TestStarter

This is my first test using GitHub class room.
It might be a colossal failure.
But it's worth a try.
     * 
If your up for an adventure, take this starter
code and change it so it prints out the
array in order, but with only recursion.
Don't use a for/while/ or do-while loop.
     * 
You'll obviously need to add a new method 
to this Main class.
